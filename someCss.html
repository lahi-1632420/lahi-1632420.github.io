	<p class="ex1">There are a lot of things that people say about languages. Whether it be that language is specifically spoken and written, or something else completely, I believe that language is something that can be understood. Anything from dance to spoken word to computer code could be seen as language. This thought came to me recently. A friend of mine explained to me her choice of double majoring in English and Computer Science. Right off the bat, it seemed odd. Then she explained to me how there are special words and codes and punctuation that makes computers work the way that they do.
	</p>
	<p class="ex2">In my own experience, understanding the evolution of language has been interesting. The Internet has become so coded with “lol” and “idk” and other words that often lead me to Urban Dictionary to attempt to understand their meanings. I have found that we have come around to some revivals of older slang, or variations of it. There is a true beauty of the dynamics of language, how we hope to be understood and to understand.
